Hi, there! My name is **Zheming Yin** (å°¹å“²é“­). I have finished the study Eletromobility M.Sc. at University of Stuttgart in April 2025. Before that, I got my B.Sc. in Automotive Engineering from Northeastern University.

**I am currently seeking PhD opportunity** and broadly interested in the machine learning, computer vision, HCI, autonomous system, image processing and so on. I would be very grateful if you could let me know of any PhD openings, or consider me if thereâ€™s a suitable opportunity.

## Experiences
- **04/2024 - 04/2025, Bosch, Stuttgart**
	- Working Student
	- Autonomous parking, extract the vehicle signals by APIs in Azure database
	- Dataset processing by Pandas, re-train models using manually labeled or database tags
	- Develop the inference processors to automatically perform inference through database API

- **05/2023 - 11/2024, IMSB & HCI-CS Institutes at University of Stuttgart**
	- Research Assistant
	- HCI (human-computer interaction), pose and gaze prediction
	- Dataset processing, such as ADT, Boxrr-23, Egobody and so on.
	- Visualize dataset and plot the results

- **10/2024 - 03/2025, master thesis, University of Stuttgart**
	- Title: Range-Doppler map upsampling for single channel chirp sequence radar using Deep Learning
	- Range-Doppler map upsampling using Transformer and GAN (generative adversarial network) models.
	- Novel loss functions combining MSE (mean square error), perceptual and adversarial loss functions
	- Range-Doppler map dataset recording and processing

- **01/2024 - 06/2024, research thesis, University of Stuttgart**
	- Title: Ray tracing channel simulation for millimeter wave indoor localization system
	- Raytracing simulation in Matlab, 3D modeling in Blender
	- Design the anisotropic radar radiation pattern of the radar as well as radar cross section of the reflector
	- Process baseband signal, range-Doppler map and CFAR (constant false alarm rate)

- **11/2020 - 06/2021, bachelor thesis, Northeastern University**
	- Title: Braking System Design based on Polestar 1
	- Calculate and design the parameters of the braking systems
	- 2D and 3D drawings by AutoCAD and Solidworks
	- Thermodynamic simulation by ANSYS and simulation by Matlab/Simulink
